 I think the column names are quite self-explanatory so I am skipping the broad data dictionary part. 
 
Throughout this analysis, I ask several questions to the dataset itself and eventually find out their answers. Sometimes, the answers were pretty straight-forward but sometimes they were not - the dataset itself needed data cleaning which made it more fun. 
 
 The sample questions are - 
 * What is the student count per department?
 * What is the highest semester grade obtained by a student from a particular department?
 and so on...
